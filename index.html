        <p>Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet. </p>
        <p>	I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder Economics Department. I research environmental economics and industrial organization. I am on the job market in 2018-2019 and am available for interviews at the ASSA Annual Meeting in Atlanta. </p>

          My job market paper,  <a href="research/butner_jmp.pdf">Gone With The Wind: Consumer Surplus From Renewable Generation</a>, uses micro-data from a large wholesale electricity market in the United States to quantify the consumer benefit from renewable generation, in particular wind turbines. I find that the potential consumer benefit is quite large, 50 to 60 USD per person per year. However, less than 70% of this benefit is realized because some electricity generators have an incentive to behave less competitively when wind turbines are generating electricity. <br>
