    <div class="left"> <br>Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet. <br>
        <p>	I am PhD Candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder Economics Department researching environmental economics and industrial organization. I am on the job market in 2018-2019, and am availble for interviews at the ASSA Annual Meeting in Atlanta. </p>
        <p> <br>
          My job market paper,  <a href="research/butner_jmp.pdf">Gone With The Wind: Consumer Surplus From Renewable Generation</a>, uses micro-data a large wholesale electricity market in the United States to quantify the consumer benefit from renewable generation, in particular wind turbines. I find that this benefit is potentially quite large, 50 to 60 USD per person per year. However, only a 70% of this is realized because electricity generator's have an incentive to act less competitivly when wind turbines are generating electricity. This is because wholesale electricity markets are structured as a multi-unit uniform price auction, and electricity generated from wind turbines is always inframarginal. <br>
