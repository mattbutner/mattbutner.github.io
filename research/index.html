I am an environmental economist that uses industrial organization and public economics to study the energy industry. This combination of fields, within economics, highlights how market structure can influence the  effectiveness and distributional implications of policy interventions, and how policy interventions can in turn have an unintended impact on market structure. In practice, my research focuses on understanding competition in electricity markets,  the economic implications of environmental policies, and the optimal design of policies addressing externalities. Methodologically, I enjoy employing derived economic theory with empirical applications.

	<h4>Gone with the Wind: Consumer Surplus from Renewable Generation, <a href="butner_jmp.pdf">paper</a></h4>
	<p> A majority of the electricity in the United States is cleared in a wholesale electricity market that is structured as a multi-unit, uniform price, auction. Over the past ten years there has been a rapid and large increase in the capacity of renewable electricity generation in these wholesale markets, drastically changing how these markets operate. One consensus is that this renewable generation is decreasing the wholesale price of electricity, as these units displace higher cost electricity generating units. Using a supply function equilibrium framework, I show how increased renewable generation can emphasize the economic incentive to withhold capacity, attenuating the impact of renewable generation on the wholesale price. Taking advantage of detailed data on the largest wholesale electricity market in the United States, I provide direct evidence that horizontally integrated firms that own wind turbines and other assets will withhold their other assets when their own wind turbine is generating electricity.  As a result, over 30% of wind generation is replacing withheld units suggesting a decrease in potential consumer surplus of 3.3 billion US Dollars from 2014 to 2016. </p>

	<h4>Concentration Effects of Heterogeneous Standards: Refinery Response to the Clean Air Act Amendments </h4>
	<p>Environmental regulations can alter the geographic and product markets in which firms compete. This impacts a firm's ability to exercise market power, and profits subsequently. This ability to charge a higher markup-over-cost can counteract the increase in the cost of production associated with the environmental regulation. In the context of the Boutique Fuel Standards resulting from the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, I use a latent profit approach to show how refineries that were more exposed to the environmental regulation were less likely to exit the market. This is consistent with a model of spatial Cournot competition in which firms can invest in a technology that allows them to charge a higher mark up.</p>

	<h4>Demand Side Emission Policies</h4>
<p>	When implementing a Pigouvian tax to address an externality, a principle is that the effectiveness of the policy is independent on where the tax is implemented. This would suggest that pricing the emissions associated with the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity would be equally effective where the electricity is produced, or where it is consumed by residential, industrial, or commercial customers. In the absence of the regulatory authority to tax emissions from generating plants, several local utilities are interested in working with their customers to make sure the price they pay reflects the true social cost of consuming electricity. Using hourly micro-data on wholesale electricity prices for seven markets in the United States, and thermal power plant emissions of CO, SO2, and NOX, from 2004 to 2015, I show that time of use policies would be effective in capturing the variation in emissions from electricity generation. However, because the electricity grid is a pool of resources with no direct physical transaction, the actual variation in average marginal damages associated with emissions is quite small. As a result, the welfare recovered from time of use emission policies would be small, especially in comparison to the benefits of time of use retail rates that reflect the wholesale price.
