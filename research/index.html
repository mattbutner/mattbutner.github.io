	<h3>Gone with The Wind: Consumer Surplus From Renewable Generation</h3>
	<p>I use a simple equilibrium framework to analytically show how a short run increase in the quantity of renewable generation should impact the price of electricity. This is a function of the slope of demand and supply, as well as a parameter for the conduct of market participants. Taking advantage of detailed data on the largest wholesale electricity market in the United States, I show the expected price reduction associated with increased renewable generation and perfect competition is not fully passed on to the market price. Instead, I find the observed price change is better explained by a model in which some market participants curtail the quantity they offered in an attempt to keep the price high. Evidence and theory show it is the horizontally integrated firms, owning wind turbines and conventional electricity generators, that curtail their ex-ante generation offer in response to their own wind generation. As a result, over 30% of wind generation is replacing these curtailed units suggesting a decrease in consumer surplus of 2 to 3 billion US Dollars from 2014 to 2016.</p>


	<h3>Concentration effects of heterogeneous standards: refinery response to the clean air act amendments </h3>
	<p>Sometimes environmental regulations will alter the geographic and product markets in which firms compete. This can impact the firmâ€™s ability to exercise market power, and profits subsequently. The boutique fuel standards related to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments did exactly this to the petroleum refining industry by mandating unconventional, cleaner burning, fuels to be used in certain counties of the United States. While the production of the cleaner fuel increased the fixed and variable cost of refineries, it also allowed them to recuperate lost profits by selling their product in a more concentrated market with a higher markup. Using a latent profit approach, I show evidence the change in profitability offset investment cost in contrast to industry claims. I then construct and simulate a model of spatial Cournot competition, where the refineries behave as multiproduct firms with capacity constraints. This supports the observed pattern of investment and exit.</p>
