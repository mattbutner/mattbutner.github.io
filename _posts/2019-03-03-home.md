I'm a graduate student in the [Economics Department at University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/economics/). Here I research environmental economics, energy, and industrial organization.

This Fall I will join the [Institute for Policy Integrity](https://policyintegrity.org/) as an Economic Fellow.
