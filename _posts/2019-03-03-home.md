I'm an economist specializing in environmental economics, energy, and industrial organization.

I received a PhD from the [Economics Department at University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/economics/). This Fall I will join the [Institute for Policy Integrity](https://policyintegrity.org/) as an Economic Fellow.
