Welcome to my personal webpage. I'm an Economist in the Office of Energy Policy and Innovation (OEPI) at the [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)](https://www.ferc.gov/). I specialize in energy economics, environmental policy, and industrial organization. Previously, I worked as an Economic Fellow at the [Institute for Policy Integrity](https://policyintegrity.org/) and received a PhD from the [Economics Department at University of Colorado](https://www.colorado.edu/economics/).
